# Database-Reporting
This program gathers information from a database that includes eleven useful tables to assist our users in creating significant reports and analyze the data. Our employees table stores all of our employeesâ€™ personal information, their position and who they report to. The customers table stores our customer information such as address and what company they are a part of. The database also includes different invoice tables, which stores a history of invoice data since 2009 from track prices to customer totals. The business users can also obtain information from the artists, albums, genres, tracks, playlists and media types (MPEG, ACC, etc.) within this database.
